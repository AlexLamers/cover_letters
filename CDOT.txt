Dear Hiring Committee,

I am eager to apply for the Program Director position at the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT). As the current Bike Chicago Specialist at Working Bikes, I have spearheaded significant expansions and strategic initiatives that directly align with CDOT’s goals of enhancing urban mobility and accessibility. With over a decade of experience in program management, particularly in sustainable transportation and community development, I am well-prepared to bring my expertise and vision to CDOT.

Professional Achievements:

At Working Bikes, my strategic efforts expanded the Bike Chicago program’s distribution from 500 to 1,200 units annually, achieving a 140% increase in accessibility. This role demanded comprehensive planning, stakeholder engagement, and detailed logistics management—skills that are crucial for the Program Director role at CDOT. My extensive involvement in this program has not only deepened my understanding of transportation challenges and solutions in urban settings but also strengthened my capabilities in forging sustainable partnerships with city officials, community leaders, and organizations.

Previous Roles:

As the Program Manager at Blackstone Bicycle Works, I revitalized the summer earn-a-bike programs, positively impacting over 20 at-risk youth in its inaugural year. My leadership enhanced the program’s visibility, effectiveness, and provided essential life skills through sustainable transportation solutions to underserved youth.

In my role as a Program Assistant at the Oasis Center, I managed projects that integrated urban planning with sustainable transportation initiatives, serving over 120 youths annually. These initiatives focused on educational and active engagement, which significantly promoted community involvement and support.

Academic Background:

My research assistantship at Vanderbilt University and advanced studies at the University of Cologne equipped me with robust analytical skills and a comprehensive understanding of environmental sustainability. These experiences have honed my strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities, particularly in implementing data-driven and innovative solutions in complex urban environments.

Conclusion:

I am excited about the opportunity to leverage my program management skills, strategic planning capabilities, and stakeholder engagement experience to contribute to CDOT’s transformative projects. I am drawn to CDOT's commitment to innovative and sustainable solutions and am enthusiastic about making a significant impact.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing in more detail how I can contribute to the CDOT’s objectives. I am available at your convenience for an interview and can be reached at (412) 728-1532 or via email at lamersa@gmail.com.

Warm regards,
